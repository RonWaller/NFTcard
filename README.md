## My process

### Built with

- Used Parcel builder
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One thing I learned is there is some more to learn.

I kept having to remind myself that I am still learning and need to keep going and it will get "easier".

### Continued development

I want to get better at writing proper HTML and CSS. I know there are better ways to do things. I want to learn Responsive mobile first design. I want to be able to not "hack" css and understand what is actually happening.
